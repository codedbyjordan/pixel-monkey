# Pixel Monkey

Pixel Monkey is a heavily WIP pixel art editor written in Zig and Raylib.

## Get started

To run Pixel Monkey, run the `./scripts/install-libs` script to install the NativeFileDialog C library (if you are on Linux, you'll need GTK installed), then run `zig build run`. Once the project is more mature, builds will be made available.
